# Lab 8 - Creating a Branch and Merging Changes

1. Connect via RDP to your developer VM
2. Open the project you created in ***Lab 5*** with Visual Studio
3. Use the **Team Explorer** to create a new branch (call it whatever you want) based on the existing master branch
4. Update the message returned by the `Main` method in Program.cs
5. Use the **Team Explorer** in Visual Studio (under Branches) to **Push** your branch to Azure Repos
6. Switch to the **Master** branch in Visual Studio **Team Explorer**, select the ***Merge*** drop-down menu, and invoke a merge from ***your branch*** to the ***master branch***
7. In **Team Explorer**, navigate to the `Sync` menu and push your latest commit to Azure Repos
8. Navigate to **dev.azure.com** and verify that your changes are reflected in the **Master** branch
